SATIRE vl.

This is not only the longest‚ but the most complete os onrauthor’o
works. With respect to his other Satires, some of them are distinguish-
ed by one excellence, and some by another3 but in this he has com·
bined them all. Forcible in argument, flowing in diction, bold, impas-
sioned‚ and sublime3 it seems as is the poet had risen with his theme,
and, conscious of its extent, taxed all his powers to do it justice.

The whole os this Satire is a bitter invective against the female sex,
and the poet endeavours to dissuade his friend Ursidius Postumus from
marriage, at the expense of the whole sex.

It would seem, from interna} evidence, that this Satire was written
under Domitian. It has few politica] allusions3 and might not, from its
subject, perham, have been displeasing to that ferociens hypocrite, who
affected, at various times, a wonderful anxiety to restrain the licentious-

ness of the age.

3. Larem : Lar signifies a god, whose image was kept within the
house and set in the chimney or on the hearth, and was supposed to
preside over and protect the house andland.

sparrow.

9. Potanda . . . magnis : according to Hesiod, in the Golden age,
men were accounted insants, and under the care of their mother, till
near a hundred years old. Potanda well suits this idea, for men might

rather be said to drink, than to suck.

fed on acoms.

11. G'oelo: ‘the air?

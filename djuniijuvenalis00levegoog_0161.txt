SATIRE 111.

Umbriam, an Aruspex, and a friend of Juvenal, disgusted at the prev-
alence of vice, and total disregard of unassuming virtue, is introduced
on the point of quitting Rome for Cumoe. The Poet accompanies him
some little way stom the city, when the honest exile, no longer able to
suppress his indignation‚ acquainte him with the causes os his retire-
ment. ,κ
What he says may be arranged under the following headsf-that Flat-
tery and Vice are the only thriving arts at Rome; that in these, par·
ticularly the first, soreigners have a manifest superiority over the na-
tives and consequently engross all favour-3 that the poor are univer-sully
exposed to scorn and insult3 that the general habits of extravagance
render it difficult sor them to subsist3 and that a crowded capim eub-
jecte them to numberless inconveniences unknown in the country: he
then again adverte to the peculiar sufferings of the poorer citizens from
the want of a well regulated police 3 these he illustrates by a variety of
examples, and concludes in· a strain of pathos and beanty‚ which winda

up the whole with singular effect.
This Satire is imitated by Smollet in his description of Londou and

Baffi, ste.

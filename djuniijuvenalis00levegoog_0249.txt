Calvinus had left a sum of money in the hands of a confidentia! per·
son3 when the restoration of this was demanded, the man, to whom it
had been entrusted, foreswore the deposit.

The indignation, expressed by Calvinus, at this breach of trust, seems
to have reached the ears of his friend Juvenal, who endeavours to soothe
and comfort hi'm under his loss ε in doing this, the poet speaks of the
villany of the times, shows that nothing can happen, but by the will of
providence‚ and that wicked men carry with them their own punish·
ment.

jury-men, who, to the amount of some hundredS, were annually chosen

for this purpose), from which he drew out the number prescribed by
law, usually, about fifty, who sat by him at the trial. When the

‘pleadings were over, they reriaed and deliberated on what had passed.
On their return, they had each three waxen tables put into their hands,
one of which was marked with the letter C. for condemno, guilty; an-
other, with the letter A. for absolvo, not guilty3 and a third, with the
letters N. L. non liquet, 1 am doubtful. Ono of these tablets, each·
person dropt privately into an urn, which the Praetor.took out, and pro·

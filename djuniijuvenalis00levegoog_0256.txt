SATIRE XIV.

The whole of this Satire is directed to the one great end of sels-
improvement. By showing the sacility, with which children copy the
vices of their parents, he points out the necessity, as well as the sacred
duty, os giving them examples of domestic purity and virtue.

After briefly enumerating the several vices, gluttony, cruelty, de-
bauchery, stc. which youth imperceptibly imbibe from their seniors;
he enters more at large into that os avarice, of which he shows the fata}
and inevitable consequences.

Having placed the absurdity, as well as the perplexity, and danger of
immoderate desires in every possible point os view, the piece concludes
with a solemn admonition to be satisfied with those comforts and con-
veniences, which nature and wisdom require, and which a decent com·
petence is easily calculated to supply.

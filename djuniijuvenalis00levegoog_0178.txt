SATIRE lv.

Juvenal, in this Satire, indulges his honest indignation against Cris-
pinus and his employer Domitian.

Aster describing some of the enormous crimes of Crispinus, the poet
makes a sudden transition to his extravagance and gluttony‚ and thereby
takes occasion to describe a ridiculous consultation, held by Domitian
over a turbet, which was too large to be contained in any dish, that
could be found. Aster a long deliberation among the senators, it was
. proposed, that the fish should be cut in pieces and thus cooked3
but at last the opinion os the senator Montanus prevailed‚ that it should
be dressed whole, and that a dish, large enough to contain it, should be

made expressly for the purpose of receiving it.
The council is then dismissed, and the Satire concludes with a most

severe censure on the Emperor-’s cruelty a'nd injustice towards some os

the hest and most worthy os the Romans.

SATIRE vn.

This Satire is addressed to Telesinus, a poet, and contains an animat-
ed account of the general discouragement, under which literature la·
boured at Rome.

Beginning with Poetry, it proceeds with great regularity through the
various departments of History, Law, Oratory, Rhetoric, and Grammar:
having many curious anecdotes interspersed‚ and each different head
enlivened with such satirical, humorous, and sentimental remark& as

naturally flow from the subject.

the reason why me'n apply themselves.— Caesdre .· the emperor Domi-

tian is probably meant.

the work or management of.

the Muses.

⁸ who may be said, like gladiatore, inter se committi.—-A sale of this kind
is called auctio, (from augeo, to increase) because the bidders raise the
price against each other.
